# Fleet Management Solution Overview
This document describes the frontend component of a comprehensive Fleet Management solution. The complete system is designed to provide real-time tracking, management, and analytics for a fleet of vehicles.
Combined with the API-Daemon, that is schedules the collection of data from different external data sources:
* European OEM Truck manufactors data stream based on rFMS and/or a mockingserver (also a project)
* Weather data
* RDW (Dutch MOT database)
* Ability to extend with
* * TPMS (continental / Goodyear)
* * Trailer data 
* * BodyBuilder data

## Core Capabilities
* The Fleet Management solution offers a range of features to help organizations manage their vehicle fleet efficiently:

* Real-Time Vehicle Tracking: Monitor the live GPS location of all vehicles on an interactive map.

* Trip History & Replay: Review historical routes, stop durations, and travel times for any vehicle.

* Maintenance Scheduling: Track vehicle service history and receive alerts for upcoming maintenance based on mileage or time.

* Driver Management: Assign drivers to vehicles and monitor performance metrics.

* Reporting & Analytics: Generate detailed reports on fuel consumption, mileage, idle time, and more to optimize fleet performance.

## API Server & Authentication
The solution is powered by a dedicated, secure backend API server.

* Availability: The API server is a separate component that handles all business logic, database interactions.

* Authentication: Access to the API is protected. The frontend application authenticates users (e.g., via JWT tokens) to ensure that only authorized personnel can view and manage fleet data. All data transmitted between the frontend and the API server is encrypted.

## Frontend Application
The Vue 3 application detailed in this README serves as the user-facing interface for the Fleet Management solution.

* Availability: This frontend is fully developed and provides an intuitive, responsive interface for accessing all the core capabilities mentioned above. It communicates exclusively with the secure API server to fetch and display data, ensuring a clean separation of concerns.
